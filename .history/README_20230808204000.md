# NodeBoost - JIT Compilation Middleware for Node.js

NodeBoost is a middleware library for Node.js that introduces Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to critical sections of your applications, enhancing runtime performance and optimizing code execution. This library is designed to help you improve the efficiency of your Node.js applications by selectively compiling specific functions for better performance.

## Features

- Selective JIT Compilation: Choose specific functions or code blocks to undergo JIT compilation, reducing overhead and improving performance where it matters most.

- Runtime Profiling: Gain insights into the execution time of JIT-compiled functions to identify bottlenecks and optimize critical sections of your application.

- Customizable Compilation: Tailor the level of optimization and compilation aggressiveness to meet your application's performance requirements.

## Installation

You can install NodeBoost using npm:

```bash
npm install node-boost
